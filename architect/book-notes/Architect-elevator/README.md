The word Architect it derives from the Greek ἀρχιτέκτων (architekton), which roughly translates into “master builder.”
Keeping in mind that this word was meant for people who built houses and structures, not IT systems, we should note that the word implies “builder,” not “designer”


Solution architect is a person with a background of engineering 
Most probably AWS and Azure certified.

Solution architects are not:
- senior developers
- firefighters

What are the main responsibilities of architects:
- connect the dots
- see trade-offs
- look beyond products
- articulate strategy
- fight complexity
- deliver

Architects are riding the elevators in the companies, some companies have several floors but at the same time 
some of them could be flat.
Classic IT companies usually are living in skyscrapers.

Architects shouldn't stay at the upper levels of building and have to
travel halfway down to meet the technical scope of the story as well.
Statements like:
- “I used to be technical.” I can’t help but retort: “I used to be a manager” (it’s true) or “Why did you stop? Were you no good at it?”

Eating caviar in the penthouse while the basement is flooded isn’t the way to transform corporate IT.

It shouldn't be treated as "Authority Without Responsibility"

In traditional IT shops, the lower floors of the building can be exclusively occupied by external consultants (Chapter 38), which allows enterprise architects to avoid getting their hands dirty.

Both the penthouse and the engine room might actually have grown quite content with being disconnected: the company leadership is under the false impression that the digital transformation is pro- ceeding nicely, whereas the folks in the engine room enjoy the freedom to try out new technologies without much supervision. Such a disconnect between pent- house and engine room resembles a cruise ship heading for an iceberg with the engines running at full speed ahead: by the time the leadership realizes what’s going on, it’s likely too late.

SOOO, sometimes architect need to be a pusher, and some time needs to be a preventer.


Even if the architect is a super-smart person, they can base decisions on only those facts that are known to them.

Based on the systems and the changes that we have there frequently we need to architect them. Good architects, therefore, deal with change. This means that they live in the system’s first derivative

Continuous Integration (CI), Continuous Deployment (CD), and configuration automation are all aspects of increasing the first derivative of software systems and thus speeding up soft- ware delivery.


## the aspects that impede change
- **Dependencies**: Too many interdependencies between a system’s components will result in small changes needing adjustments in many places
- **Poor quality**: There’s a common disbelief that good quality requires extra time and effort. The inverse is actually true: poor quality slows down software deliv- ery. Changes to a poorly tested or poorly built system take more time and are more likely to break things.
- **Fear**: Poor quality and low levels of automation make change a risky proposition. Developers will thus be afraid of making changes.
- 

### If fear slows you down, confidence should speed you up
determining whether a system has sufficient test coverage shouldn’t be meas- ured in the percentage of lines of code covered. Rather, it should be measured by whether teams can make changes confidently.

### separation
it would seem natural to construct a system such that components are separated by rate of change

### Enterprise Architecture
EA forges the connection between the business and IT.
Enterprise architecture is the glue between business and IT architecture.
Enterprise architecture (EA) isn’t a pure IT function but also considers business processes, which are part of a company’s operating model.
Connecting business and IT is easier if the business side of the organization also has a well-defined architecture.
Most digital giants don’t have EA departments because their business and IT are tightly interlinked.

### IT Is from Mars, Business Is from Venus
EA will add a new floor between IT and Business, that's why EA department’s objective must be to make itself obsolete, or at least smaller.

a successful architect must stand on three “legs”:
Skill: Skill brings this knowledge to life by successfully applying it to specific problems.
Impact: The measure of how well an architect applies his or her skill to benefit the company.
Leadership: Mentoring junior architects can save a new generation of architects many years of learning by doing. Such sharing can be done via numerous channels, including academic publications, magazine articles, teaching at university, teaching professional courses, speaking at conferences, or blogging.

Note: A Chair Can’t Stand on Two Legs

### Architects as Single source of failure
As architects, we know that scaling vertically (getting smarter) works only up to a certain level and can lead to a single point of failure (you!). There- fore, you need to scale horizontally (Chapter 30) by deploying your knowledge to multiple architects.
The old saying that to really understand something you need to teach it to someone else is most true for architecture.


Humans are terrible decisions makers, especially when small probabilities and grave outcomes like death are involved.
A sparrow in the hand is better than the pigeon on the roof.
**Priming**: Priming is routinely used in retail scenarios. When presented with a choice between a “premium” beer for $2.60 and a “bargain” one for $1.80, about two thirds of test subjects (students) chose the premium beer. Adding a third, “super-premium” beer for a whopping $3.40 shifted student’s desire so that 90% ordered the premium beer and 10% the super-premium.
**Micromort**: Decision analysis helps us think rationally about our earlier jar-with-pills example. A one-in-one-million chance of dying is called one micromort.

**George Box**  “all models are wrong, but some are useful.”
We can use models to improve our decisions.
For example in IT world, one of the most challenging decisions is about uptime and buying servers.

Most of the time we have to create revertable decisions.

Question everything!
Toyota is using a system called "five whys!"

These are often the same candidates who answer the “why” questions with “because we have no time”


## Architecture
There Always Is an Architecture. Not matter how small or big the project is.
Once we come to this realization, statements like “we don’t have time for architecture” aren’t particularly meaningful.
so I suggest you pick your architecture.

### Definition
The set of design decisions about any system that keeps its implementors and maintainers from exercising needless creativity.
So when someone presents some PowerPoint or charts in behalf of his/her system design, it must contain decisions.
Systems architecture doesn’t need to be something terribly complicated. It must include, however, significant decisions that are well documented and are based on a clear rationale.

Measuring an architect’s contribution by the number of decisions they’re making reminded me of trying to measure developers’ productivity in lines of code written. 

It is better to have Irreversible decisions and Defer them with Options.
Design systems to defer decisions. (server sizing).
Good architects offer a range of options at different strike prices and cost instead of aiming for a minimum strike price at all cost.
